    <h1>Baseball Statistics Visualizations</h1>
    <h2>Purpose of this website:</h2>
    <p>The baseball statistics application allows users to explore five different baseball trends over time. The trends focus on team and player statistics and explore questions such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The connection between runs-to-outs by salary range, which helps explore whether higher paid players tend to have better offensive performance and how this relationship evolves over different seasons</li>
      <li>Team spending and winning percentage, which sheds light on whether higher team spending translates into more victories</li>
      <li>The distribution of foreign-born MLB players and their relation to team wins/losses, which aims to understand the contributions of increasingly global players</li>
      <li>The influence of player height on performance, which addresses questions about whether taller or shorter players have advantages in specific aspects of the game</li>
      <li>The effect homeruns have on the chances of a player appearing in the postseason, which explores whether prolific home run hitters are likely to impact their teamâ€™s chances of making it to the postseason.</li>
    </ul>
