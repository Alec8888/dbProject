    <h1>Team Spending Per Win</h1>
    <h2>Determine the influence over time that team salary has had on the number of wins.</h2>
    <p>The user selects one or many teams and a range of seasons. The salaries of the selected teams are calculated from the playersâ€™ and managers' salaries. The spending per win is calculated for each team. The average spending per win for all teams is also calculated, which serves as a reference point. Each year's spending amounts are adjusted for inflation as of the end of 2022. </p>
