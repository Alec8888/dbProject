# Formulas for Baseball Statistics
## Batting Statistics
### Batting Average
$BA = \frac{H}{AB}$
- where $H$ is the number of hits and $AB$ is the number of at bats.
- How often a player gets a hit when he is at bat.
### On-Bases Percentage
$OBP = \frac{H + BB + HBP}{AB + BB + HBP + SF}$
- where $H$ is the number of hits, $BB$ is the number of bases on balls (walks), $HBP$ is the number of times hit by pitch, $AB$ is the number of at bats, and $SF$ is the number of sacrifice flies.
- How often a player gets on base.
### Slugging Percentage
$SLG = \frac{1B + 2B*2 + 3B*3 + HR*4}{AB}$
- where $1B$ is the number of singles, $2B$ is the number of doubles, $3B$ is the number of triples, $HR$ is the number of home runs, and $AB$ is the number of at bats.
- How often a player gets extra bases when he is at bat.## Calculations
