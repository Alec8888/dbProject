# Instructions for building and using the app locally. 

## Links:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
## Pull from github 
- clone the repo to your local machine  
``` git clone https://github.com/Alec8888/dbProject ```
## Project file structure
- dbProject
  - client
  - server
## Install project dependencies
### Server
- Install node.js v18.17.1
- Install modules in server directory:  
  ``` npm install ```
    - the modules are defined in package.json
### Client
- Install Quasar/Vue CLI  
  ``` npm install -g @quasar/cli ```
## Oracle demo setup
- Log into Orcal with SQL Developer and connect to the CISE Oracle.
- Create a table DEMOTABLE using the UI
- Edit the table and add three columns.
- Insert some data into the table.
here's what I inserted in my example:
INSERT INTO DEMOTABLE (COLUMN1,COLUMN2,COLUMN3) 
VALUES ('demo2', 5, TO_DATE('1/2/2023', 'MM/DD/YYYY'))
- In our project create the file ./server/.env and enter your user and pwd for UF oracal db. The format of the .env file contents is shown below.
  - the .env file is not tracked by git so your credentials will not be shared  

```DB_USER=oracleUser```  
```DB_PASSWORD=oraclePassword```
## Start App
### Server
- run server.js from server directory  
  ``` node server.js ```
- Leave the terminal window open.
### Client
- Open a new termial window that is not powershell
- Start dev server from client directory  
  ``` quasar dev ```
  - website should launch after command
### Alternative: Start both with one command
- First try it with the two terminal windows and two commands, then try this when you get tired of that. Run from /dbProject/server  
``` npm run dev ```
## Check out the website
If you click the button on the home page, records stored in the oracle db are displayed.
## DB connection issues
- Double check you are using the UF VPN
- Make sure environment variables are set correctly
- Are both the server and client running? Two terminal windows should be open.

## How does this work?
1. Start by reading the code in the file /client/src/pages/quertOne.vue. This is the page that is displayed when you click the button on the home page. The code in this file calls the server and the server calls the oracle db. The data is returned to the client and displayed on the page.
2. Next read the code in /server/server.js. This is the file that starts the server and defines the routes. The route for the query is defined in this file. Also, the connection to the oracle db is defined in this file. The connection is made using the credentials in the .env file. The connection is made using the oracledb module. The query is executed using the connection and the results are returned to the client.
